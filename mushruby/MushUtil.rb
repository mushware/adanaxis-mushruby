class MushUtil < MushObject
# Class: MushUtil
#
# Description:
#
# Provides a number of utilities for <MushVector> and <MushRotation>
# manipulation.  It supplies only singleton methods.
#
# Method: cRotateAndSeek
#
# Rotates and moves and object's <MushPost> to point at and move
# toward a point.  
#
# Parameters:
#
# ioPost - The object's <MushPost>, which will be modifed
# inTarget - The target <MushVector>, which the object will point at and move towards
# inSpeed - Maximum speed of movement in world units per frame
# inAcceleration - Acceleration of linear and angular motion 0.0 .. 1.0
#
# Returns:
#
# None.
#
# Example:
#
# (example)
#   rotation1 = MushTools.cRotationInPlane(PLANE_YW, Math::PI / 2)
# (end)
#
