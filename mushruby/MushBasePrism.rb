class MushBasePrism < MushBase
# Class: MushBasePrism
#
# Description:
#
# This object is used as a base shape for a <MushMesh> object, and provides a prism
# based on a regular polygon.  A 2D polygon is created with the requested number of sides,
# within a circle of radius 0.5.  This polygon is extruded to produce a 3D prism,
# and that 3D prism is again extruded to generate the 4D prism.
#
# Face numbering is as follows
#
# 0 - w = -0.5
# 1 - w = +0.5
# 2 - z = -0.5
# 3 - z = +0.5
# 4 - x = +k
# 5..(order+3) - rotating anticlockwise in the xy plane
#
# Example for order = 4
#
# 5 - y = +k
# 6 - x = -k
# 7 - y = -k
#
# where k becomes 0.5/sqrt(2) to contain the square within radius 0.5.
#
# Method: new
#
# Creates a BasePrism object, ready to add to a mesh.  
#
# Parameters:
#
# order - Number of sides of the initial polygon
#
# The parameter can be supplied as a single value or hash
#
# Returns:
#
# New MushBasePrism object
#
# Default:
#
# There is no default constructor.  The order parameter must be provided.
#
# Example:
#
# (example)
#   baseprism1 = MushBasePrism.new(5)
#   baseprism2 = MushBasePrism.new(:order => 5)
# (end)
